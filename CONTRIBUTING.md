# Running the extension for Development

To run and test the extension locally in development mode:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/0x2a-42/vscode-lelwel.git
cd vscode-lelwel
npm install
npm run compile
```

Then open `src/extension.ts` and press F5 (or select **Run â†’ Start Debugging**) to launch a new **Extension Development Host** window.

Open a .llw file in that window to test the extension.
